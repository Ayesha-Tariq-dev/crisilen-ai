  executiveSummary: `CRISIS SITUATION REPORT - September 14, 2025

Multiple high-severity events are currently affecting various regions globally:

1. Pacific Ring Earthquake (Critical):
- 8.1 magnitude event with tsunami risks
- Multiple coastal populations threatened
- International response mobilizing

2. Hurricane Marcus (Critical):
- Category 5 hurricane approaching Florida
- 2 million+ in evacuation zones
- Storm surge up to 20 feet expected

3. Climate Emergencies:
- Arctic permafrost collapse releasing methane
- Mediterranean heat dome affecting 20M+
- Amazon mega-fire threatening ecosystems

4. Technology Crisis:
- AI system failure in Singapore affecting critical infrastructure
- Highlights emerging risks in smart city systems

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Immediate international coordination required
- Climate crisis impacts intensifying globally
- Tech infrastructure vulnerabilities need addressing

Current global crisis index indicates an unprecedented level of simultaneous major events requiring coordinated international response.`,
